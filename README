# Terraform Provider Oxide Demo

To try out the provider you'll need to follow these steps:

- Have a Nexus server running.
- Have Terraform [installed](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) locally.
- Run `make install` from the root of this repository. This will install the plugin in your local Terraform plugins directory.
- From the `examples/` directory run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to use the example Terraform configuration file.
